Spotify Wrapped has been released by Spotify every year since 2016, and is a fun way for users to see listening data such as, minutes listened, top artists and genres. It’s individual, yes, we have had Apple Music’s Replay 2022 and similar things like Instagram’s Top Nine posts of the year-, but nothing creates quite the same hype. Spotify do a great job of changing themes, colours and data for each year, to keep it new and exciting, and it seems that each year people get more excited than the last. This year Spotify have sorted users into one of sixteen listening personalities, and that’s not the only new feature, as the music streaming behemoth continues on its mission to connect listeners with their fans.
